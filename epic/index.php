			<p>The overall objective is to create a simple interactive tool that allows anyone to see where and how our local tax money is being spent.
				The user will be anonymous and will have the option to easily create a graph based on the data they have asked for.
				Once you give people, advocacy leaders and small business owners this tool, it can be utilized to create accountability and more
				competition amoung city vendors. We hope the site will help display more transparency for all of Albuqeurque tax payers.
