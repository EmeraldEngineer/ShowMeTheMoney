			<p>This site is to inform local Albuquerque residents about where and how their tax dollars are being spent. It will also be informative for current
			and future businesses to see possible tax incentives, government bids and government bonds. Albuquerque Community advocates will be able to gather information about funding projects and events.
			We hope to inform and display some overall transparency for all of Albuqeurque tax payers.</p>
