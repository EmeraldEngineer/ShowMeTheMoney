			<h1>Use Case for Adriana Vasquez</h1>
			<p>Adriana is an investigative journalist looking to find reliable data about how the city pays its vendors: who gets city contracts, how often, and how much they are getting paid by the city. She would also like an app that will translate this data into user-friendly graphs that she can post into her articles.</p>

			<h1>Use Case for Maricela Diaz</h1>
			<p>Maricela and her staff are constantly doing research about government spending for their nonprofit's campaigns. Maricela was told about showmethemoney.com from one of her volunteers as a quick way to search the city's vendor database and create reliable, user-friendly graphs that can then be shared on their social media channels, ultimately assisting their campaigns.</p>
