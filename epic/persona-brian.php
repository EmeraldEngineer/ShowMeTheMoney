	</head>
	<body>
		<strong>Name:</strong> Brian Murphy<br>
		<strong>Age:</strong> 25<br>
		<strong>Profession:</strong> Teacher<br>
		<strong>Technology:</strong> Android LG G3, Windows 10. Brian uses his desktop to do most of his research and school work and his phone for minimal app use with typical on-the-go mobile web browsing<br>
		<strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Brian works an incredible amount of hours at a local APS middle school. He is somewhat knowledgeable about politics, primarily focused on elections that matter to him as an educator like school board, district and city elections.<br>
		<strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Brian has limited time as an educator but it's important for him to stay on top of local politics. Specifically, what city bonds are getting funded and how well his school district will get funded. He has a hard time understanding why the same districts continue to get more funding, while he feels his school is in desperate need of basic necessities that always get overlooked.<br>
		<strong>Goals:</strong> Brian wishes there was a website where he could easily access Albuquerque's tax database so he could understand how our education budget is being spent. This would empower him with the facts and imformation to talk about getting the neccessary funds, with his local cheetos (public officials).<br>
